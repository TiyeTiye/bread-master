    <p>The development of bread goes hand in hand with the development of civilization itself. It has followed farming, spreading out with humanity across the world, with it's earliest evidence dating back over 10,000 years. Bread has fueled exploration, supported the building of monuments, and kept everyone from the humblest farmer to the greatest king alive through a long, cold winter. Yet at its core, bread is actually a very simple food, made out of very simple ingredients. To make your own loaf of bread, you will only need the following:</p>
    <ul id="ingredients">
      <li>Flour</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Yeast</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="Pick_Your_Flour">
    <header>Pick Your Flour</header>
    <p>Most bread recipes today call for white all-purpose flour, wheat flour, or a mixture of both.
Of the two, white flour will produce a lighter, airier loaf of bread, with a better rise than wheat flour, and it often bleached with a chemical whitening agent to give it a clean white appearance.
    <br><br>
Wheat flour comes from the same source as white flour, but importantly has not had the bran and wheat germ removed, giving it higher levels of fiber, as well as higher levels of iron, calcium, and protein. It also makes bread that has a richer, almost nutty flavor.
  <br><br>
  But bread dough doesn't just have to come from wheat flour, there are a variety of different flours from around the world that can also be used. Flours from sources like:</p>
    <ul id="flours">
      <li>Rye</li>
      <li>Buckwheat</li>
      <li>Rice</li>
      <li>Spelt</li>
      <li>Gluten-free Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <code>TIP: If using alternative flours, be sure to double check your recipe and the flour's packaging. Bread dough made from alternative flours can require different amounts of water, longer rising times, and different baking times or temperatures. </code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Dry_Yeast_vs._Sourdough_Starter">
    <header>Dry Yeast vs. Sourdough Starter</header>
    <p>Bread baked today can be leavened, or risen, with either commercial yeast or yeast grown in a sourdough starter. Commercial yeast can be found in grocery stores, and is sold in packets or jars, while sourdough starter is very simple to make at home yourself. The main differences between the two is that while commercial yeast produces a quicker, more reliable rise than sourdough starter, it comes from only a single strain of yeast and doesn't impart the tangy, sour flavor that you get when using sourdough.</p>

    <header>Variations on a Classic</header>
    <p>A variety of mix-ins can be added to any loaf of bread to create a whole host of different flavors. Ingredients like honey, milk, eggs, butter, or oil act as "tenderizers" to create a much softer loaf of bread, similar to store bought in texture. Sugar or honey will not only give your bread a slightly sweeter taste, but also a beautiful color. Fresh and dried herbs give your bread a great taste as well as a delicious scent. Carmelized onion, cheese, fruit, chopped nuts, or roasted vegetables can turn a regular loaf of bread into something fit for a feast.</p>
    <code>TIP: Any add-in can affect rising times for a batch of bread dough. Eggs and butter will weight down the yeast and require a longer rising time to get dough that has been properly risen or "proofed." Larger add-ins like fruit or nuts will have a smiliar effect. Sugar, honey, or molasses feed yeast molecules and can make your bread rise faster. Be sure to keep an eye on your dough as it rises and don't let it get over proofed!</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Kneading_and_Proofing">
    <header>Kneading and Proofing</header>
    <p>Once all your flour has been incorporated into your dough, it it time to knead the mixture. The goal is to build up enough gluten fibers to trap the gases caused by your yeast and enable a good rise. If kneading by hand, this usually takes around 10 minutes. If using a stand mixer, you can cut your kneading time in half.</p>
    <code>TIP: A good way to test if your bread is kneaded enough is to see if it pases the "windowpane test." Take a small piece of dough and stretch it in front of a light source or window. If your bread is properly kneaded and you've built up enough gluten, you should be able to see light through it before it tears.</code>
    <p>Once your dough has been kneaded enough and passes the windowpane test, place it in an oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap, and leave it to rise or "proof" until it has doubled in size.</p>
    <code>TIP: A good way to tell if your dough is properly proofed is called the "finger-dent test." Gently poke your dough with a clean finger, making a dent about half and inch deep. If the dough springs back quickly, it is under proofed and needs more time. If it springs back slowly, it is just right and ready to be baked. If it does not spring back at all it is over proofed and may collapse during baking.</code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Shaping_Your_Loaf">
    <header>Shaping Your Loaf</header>
    <p>Once your dough is fully proofed the goal is to shape it into its final loaf as gently as possible, to avoid knocking out the gas bubbles created by your yeast. Use a dough scraper, dull side of a butter knife, or kitchen scissors to cut off the amount you need from your dough ball, and then with floured or oiled hands, try to handle your dough as little as possible as you shape it into its final form.
      <br><br>
      In addition to the traditional round loaf or boule, your dough can be baked in a plethora of ways. You can try turning it into:</p>
    <ul id="shapes">
      <li>Baguettes</li>
      <li>Ciabatta</li>
      <li>Flatbreads</li>
      <li>Focaccia</li>
      <li>Pizza</li>
      <li>Sandwich Loaves</li>
      <li>Braided Loaves</li>
      <li>Anything else your heart desires!</li>
    </ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="Baking">
    <header>Baking</header>
    <p>For best results, bake your bread on a pizza stone, cast iron skillet, or heavy duty cookie sheet. All of these will retain the heat of the oven and help give your bread a crisp crust. Generally, "plain breads," those made with only flour, water, salt, andyeast will require higher baking temperatures, while doughs with extra added ingredients will require lower baking temperatures. Check your recipe to make sure and avoid burning your loaf.
    <br><br>
      Once your oven is preheated and yor dough has fully proofed, dust the top of your loaf with flour or brush it with water, and then use a sharp knife to score a series of 1/4" to 1/2" deep cuts in its top. This helps the bread to fully rise as it bakes and prevents a dense, tough loaf.
    </p>
    <code>TIP: Bread developes a better crust when it is baked with steam. This can come from baking your bread in a container with a lid, trapping its moisture, or adding a heat-proof container to the oven and filling it with 1 cup of water at the same time you place in your dough, or simply covering your bread dough with a simple piece of tinfoil to trap steam as it bakes. </code>

  <section class="main-section" id="Storing_Your_Bread">
    <header>Storing Your Bread</header>
    <p>After your bread has cooled, the best place to store it is in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight. Wrapped in plastic or in a plastic bag is a great option for bread storage, as is a metal or wooden countertop breadbox. Most fresh-baked bread will last for about a week this way.</p>
    <code>TIP: For bread that has gone hard, spritz it in water and microwave at 15 second intervals until it is soft enough to slice and eat.</code> 
    <p>Be sure not to store your bread in the refrigerator - this will make your bread go stale faster! If you won't be able to finish your bread within a week, you can always pre-slice your loaf, put the whole thing in the freezer, and defrost it piece by piece as you need it.</p>
